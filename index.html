        <h3>My journey so far</h3>
          <p>Left the finance arena after 14 years spent in Investment Banking and Private Equity.  Started a new professional life in September and set myself two objectives: i) take the plunge into entrepreneurship; ii) learn to code. </br></br>
          I have been exploring multiple opportunities with potential partners and <strong>finally ended up by lauching Qonto.eu! </strong></br></br>
          With respect to coding, this page has been coded during <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/program" target="_blank">the FullStack program @LeWagon.</a> That was probably the best experience of my entire life.</p>

              <td><strong>HEAT</strong><br/>Heat is a 1995 American crime film written, co-produced and directed by Michael Mann, and starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Val Kilmer. De Niro plays Neil McCauley, a professional thief, while Pacino plays Lt. Vincent Hanna, an LAPD robbery-homicide detective tracking down McCauley's crew. The story is based on the former Chicago police officer Chuck Adamson's pursuit during the 1960s of a criminal named McCauley, after whom De Niro's character is named. Heat is a remake by Mann of an unproduced television series he had worked on, the pilot of which was released as the TV movie L.A. Takedown in 1989.</td>

              <td><strong>CITY OF GOD</strong><br/>City of God (Portuguese: Cidade de Deus) is a 2002 Brazilian crime film directed by Fernando Meirelles and co-directed by Katia Lund, released in its home country in 2002 and worldwide in 2003. The story was adapted by Bráulio Mantovani from the 1997 novel of the same name written by Paulo Lins, but the plot is loosely based on real events. It depicts the growth of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro, between the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1980s, with the closure of the film depicting the war between the drug dealer Lil Zé and vigilante-turned-criminal Knockout Ned. The tagline is "If you run, the beast catches you; if you stay, the beast eats you."</td>
